# Overview

All code associated with the plant shop project is under the directory /project and all with the assignment is under /assignment. Each project has the app.js file declaring the angular module. The config.js declares the navigation of the application.
Every controller uses the client service associated with it to make the http requests. Those are sent to the server side service to handle - instructing the model to handle data on the database.
